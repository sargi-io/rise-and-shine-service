I work as a Software Engineer and I love it. But now my job is becoming more and more stressful.
That is why I started new hobbies outside IT. I really like cooking, and I also started to enjoy video games.
I am currently playing Borderlands 3 and having absolute blast.
I would like to also start exercising more and eat healthier.
